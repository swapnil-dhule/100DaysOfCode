A parameter is a variable defined in the function definition that represents a value that the function expects to receive when it is called. Parameters are listed inside the parentheses that follow the function name. Here's an example:

def my_function(param1, param2):

In this example, param1 and param2 are the parameters of the my_function function.




An argument, on the other hand, is a value that is passed to a function when it is called. Arguments are the actual values that are assigned to the corresponding parameters when the function is called. Here's an example:

my_function(10, 20)

In this example, 10 and 20 are the arguments that are passed to the my_function function.




In summary, parameters are placeholders in a function definition that represent the expected inputs to the function, whereas arguments are the actual values that are passed to the function when it is called.
